## model/
The primary model (the one made on campus thrus/fri) 

## model-hf/
The model I (Hannes) made to recap CNN's and pytorch. Mostly similar but coded a bit differently, with a different CNN layout.

## Other models
Feel free to add your own model as a repository if you want to practice the coding aspect aswell. Make sure the data is in a sub-directory called "data/" so that git does not push those files to the repository (See "model/"). Feel free to edit this README after you do.
